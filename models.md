# Models

Some notes about models, and classes. 

## Class of Structures 

Given a formula $\varphi$, the class of structures is all models that satisfy $\varphi$. There are certain classes that can be 
described using different logics. Following are classes that can be described using FOL.  

### Elementary (EC) 

A Class is elementary if a single sentence can descibe it. If there are multiple sentences describing it, one can take the conjunction
and turn them into a single sentence.

### Extended Elementary

Need a set of sentences to describe the class. My understanding is that it may also be referred to the axiom schema of the structure being
defined.
