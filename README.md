Notes that I've been taking while studying for this course. If you plan on having a look, please keep a couple of things in mind - 
* They may not be accurate. By accurate, I mean mathematically accurate.
* They're meant to provide a simplistic view on logic (like one would explain to a five year old). They might not be appropriate if you prefer concise, and mathematical explanations. 

I've been experimenting with using Pandoc, instead of latex. It allows for embedding latex formulas in regular readme documents.
